,,Online Workshop Camp Or Class,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kids,,,,,,,,,,,robotics,,,,,,,,Build BOTS with Kathy Ceceri,"Build BOTS with Kathy Ceceri is a complete robotics course kids can do at home -- no expensive kits needed!

In this 5-week live course for ages 7-11, we'll talk about about different robotics systems and how they are used in real life and in the lab. Every week, we'll make a short hands-on project each based on Kathy's books, including ""BOTS! Robotics Engineering with Makerspace Activities for Kids."" Written instructions for the in-class project will be available online, along with additional activities you can do on your own and share with the class the following week!

Topics we'll cover include:

• What a robot is and what they can do
• Different ways to power a robot
• How robots get around, and how they pick up and move stuff
• How sensors help robots decide what to do
• How to create real and virtual robots and control them with free, online software like Microsoft MakeCode.","Kids, join us for a complete robotics course you can do at home -- no expensive kits needed!",,,,lateelementary,,,No,,,No,,,,,,"To do the projects in this course, all you need are some household supplies (such as index cards, pencils, and scissors), and a few electronics.

I know some may not have had the time to purchase supplies for this class, but there are ways to work around that. You'll want to head to the dollar store and grab four electric tealights. I'll show you how to hack them for parts. You'll also want aluminum foil, scissors, and a glue stick. These itesm will be used to replace the LEDs, batteries, and copper/Maker tape.

If you don't mind, can you tell me a bit about yourself so that I can customize the class to your needs? Are you a young student looking to learn? A teen hoping to try something new? A teacher interested in projects for their class? An adult hobbyist who's naturally curious? I'd love to know more about you!

I am really looking forward to working with you next week. Origami circuits are some of my favorite things to make. You can find more of my step-by-step projects for free on <a href=""https://makeprojects.com/profile/KaleidoscopeSci"">Make Projects</a>!

,,Online Workshop Camp Or Class,,,,,,,,,,,craft,,,,education,,,fun-games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Make Stuff with micro:bit,"Make stuff. Learn to code. Have fun. In this class, you'll join Maker Camp host and real-life educator, Sandy Roberts, as we explore, craft, and create together using the micro:bit.

The micro:bit by the BBC is an easy-to-code, inexpensive microcontroller designed to introduce kids to physical computing. By using Microsoft MakeCode, young coders can transform the micro:bit into a myriad of devices from game controllers to secret message senders, robots to weather stations. With tons of technology nestled into a board smaller than a credit card, the micro:bit provides many avenues for discovery and invention. In this workshop, we’ll build four different hands-on projects that explore a wide variety of applications for the micro:bit. Class size is limited!

Projects will include:
Hack-a-Badge - Learn the basics of micro:bit as you design your own unique name badge, perfect for any budding mad scientist or secret agent. We’ll start with simple things like creating a badge animation and flashing your name. Then we’ll discover how to send secret messages to others. Finally, we’ll customize our badges to report important data like the temperature, the direction you’re headed, how fast you’re moving, and more. Finish off your creation by wiring the microbit to your custom created badge front piece and show it off to the world!

Set-a-Trap - Protect your lab (or bedroom) with a sneaky set of traps and alarms designed to keep pesky parents and annoying siblings away from your stuff! We’ll start with a clever door alarm and then move on to more complex designs: a light-sensitive alarm and a pressure-sensitive alarm. We’ll even learn to design our own melodic alarm music. With these techy tools, you’ll never need to worry about being spied on again!

Build-a-Bot - Every mad scientist needs a monster robot to be his minion (and BFF)! So let’s build and code a bot of our own using the micro:bit and some junk from around the house! With this project, you’ll learn about some simple machines as you prototype and test your creation. Then go wild with the art supplies and give your bot some character!

Smack-a-S’more - Smack-a-S’more is the inventive take on “Whack a Mole” that puts both your crafting creativity and coding skills to use. We’ll start by making your own plushy S’more character out of upcycled materials. Then we’ll learn MS Code for the micro:bit to code a game that can be played by one or many. So get silly. Get hands-on. And get smart with this fantastic STEAM project!","Make stuff. Learn to code. Have fun.

I will show you the major parts of a patent application and then how to review patent applications from various technical fields of endeavor and understand why patent practitioners are making the choices they make when drafting an application, and it is also easy to identify high quality, well-written patent applications.

While drafting a patent application is difficult, it is obviously not impossible. With some coaching, guidance and perseverance virtually anyone can learn how to do it. The problem, however, is the same as with any form of writing. Staring at a blank screen is only a recipe for further staring at a blank screen.  I will show you how to break the cycle of staring at a blank screen (or page). Go forth and get your invention protected.

Before the day you will need to do a couple of things:
<ul>
 	<li>Get yourself <strong>a mouse with a scroll wheel and a '3rd mouse button'</strong> if you haven't got one already (e.g a scroll wheel that you can click in). A mouse with these traits is <em>essential</em> for navigating within the program. Touchpads or mice without the scroll-wheel and third button will not work with this software.</li>
 	<li>Please also <strong>download and install fusion 360</strong> from <a href=""https://www.autodesk.com.au/products/fusion-360/free-trial"">here</a> (it's free if you're not making money from it). Just download/sign up for the trial, at the end of the 30 days it will ask you which license you wish to proceed with and you will want to select hobbist. Please also open it at least once before the session and go through any sign in/ log in requirements so we can dive right in on the day (please also do this if you downloaded it a while ago as you may need to renew your hobby/free license).</li>
</ul>

<p class=""p1"">This biotechnology class will help you to discover what biotechnology is, and how to use it to make new and exciting things. You'll even try your hand at genetic engineering, no prior knowledge necessary!</p>
<p class=""p1"">Already, biotechnology affects more than a billion people every year and is a core part of our society. Yet, only a small fraction of the population understands and can use it to help solve the world's biggest problems; from fuel to food to medicine, all the way to new sustainable, and exciting materials.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Whether you are looking to explore the potential of biotechnology as a maker, wanting to see if a career path in biotechnology is right for you, or even gain some biotechnology teaching skills yourself, this course will help you reach your goal! Each student will learn the fundamentals of biotechnology and apply them in their own hands-on experiments using the class materials. From making bio-art to engineering bacteria with the DNA from sea creatures to seeing DNA in real life, you'll have the chance to ask your questions, problem-solve and discuss biotechnology applications, ethics and impacts. Join this class to complete your Zero to Genetic Engineering Hero learning Journey alongside your peers!</p>
<p class=""p1"">As part of this class, learners will have the chance to flex their existing making skills, from programming to crafting, by building their own incubator, improving on the designs, and exploring the world of bio-electronics and lab equipment as part of an optional personal project.</p>

I'm Maddy.</h2>
I'm your instructor for this workshop! My company has built e-textile systems for household names like Google and Microsoft I've been featured by Forbes, WIRED and American Express.

My professional life has been spent fusing together design and technology and I know how tricky it can be to get started with hardware prototyping coming from a non-hardware background. <strong>That's why I specifically designed this course around the needs of beginners</strong> to help overcome barriers for getting started with technical projects.

Even if you don't have a background in tech, engineering, or electrics, you can <strong>get a solid foundation</strong>, <strong>ask for advice</strong>, and <strong>avoid costly mistakes</strong> (like setting your battery on fire—whoops!) in a friendly, judgement free environment.

Whether you want to take your career to the next level, or simply become a Woz-like tinkerer, <strong>I hope you'll join us.</strong>",https://www.loomia.com/,https://www.instagram.com/loomia_tech/|https://twitter.com/loomia_tech,Yes,Yes,https://loomia.mykajabi.com/live-q-a-1,comfortable,"Camera: HP laptop built in webcam

,,Online Workshop Camp Or Class,,,,,,,,,computers-mobile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,technology,,,,Intro to Live-Streaming,"Zoom and Meet have become the norm for classes and gatherings these days. Often, the limited functionality of conferencing software doesn't go far enough to help you get your ideas across and hold the attention of your audience. Dedicated livestream software lets you build scenes, share media, and truly present creatively on platforms your audience already uses like YouTube Live, Facebook Live, Zoom, and anything else that let's you plug in a virtual camera. In exploring the packages available and techniques used to lead sessions from classes to family gatherings, we'll build an interactive quiz show, suitable for a small group of friends. Once you've mastered the concepts used to make a fast-paced quiz, you'll understand how to apply all of this to future classes and presentations that you offer on your own YouTube channel or here through Maker Campus!

Two livestream packages will be used in class: Ecamm Live, and OBS Studio. OBS works on multiple platforms and is completely free. Ecamm is a Mac-based application that has a free trial period that you can use during class. The real diehard tinkerer can even get OBS Studio running on a Raspberry Pi. It is not necessary to run Ecamm to take this class. It is recommended for those on Macs due to it's less resource intensive requirements.",Learn to livestream your own presentations by learning to build an interactive quiz show for family.,adults,highschool,,,,,Yes,Anyone able to participate in Zoom meetings can learn to go to the next level of live-streaming.,Learn to build scenes in live-streaming software that can enhance your online presentations.,Yes,yes,other,,free download,,"Participants will need to install either OBS Studio (or a variant) or Ecamm Live.

While working on his M.S. in Teaching and Curriculum, way back in 1997, he wrote a paper on using the new fangled web as a teaching tool. He was laughed at by his professors and fellow students, but now enjoys the last laugh as a global pandemic has moved most classrooms online. These days, Larry conducts meetings, teaches classes, and streams performances almost daily. Larry is best known to the maker community for the large-scale sculpture installations that his studio, Airigami, has created for Maker Faires around the world.
